This is a **MATLAB** implementation for **hyper-graph matching** and image correspondences as presented in [Game theoretic hypergraph matching for multi-source image correspondences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305696390_Game_Theoretic_Hypergraph_Matching_for_Multi-source_Image_Correspondences). 

## Environment

The code has been tested on **Windows 7** (64-bit) operating system (OS) with **MATLAB2013a**.

## Usage

1. Execute `siftWin32.exe` (**Windows** OS is required) before running the hyper-graph matching code.

2. Run `run_matching.m` on MATLAB for image correspondences based on hyper-graph matching.

- Note: Tuning **parameters** (i.e., `distRatio`, `imresizerate1` and `imresizerate2`) to larger value (less than 1) will generate more key points and result in low matching speed.

- Note: The running time reported in our paper dose not include the time of establishing hyper-graphs (i.e., the time of computing hyper-edges).
