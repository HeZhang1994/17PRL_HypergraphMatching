This is a **Matlab** implementation of **hyper-graph matching** based multi-source image correspondences. The theoretic formulation of this method was presented in [Game theoretic hypergraph matching for multi-source image correspondences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305696390_Game_Theoretic_Hypergraph_Matching_for_Multi-source_Image_Correspondences).

## Usage

1. Execute `siftWin32.exe` (**Windows** OS is required) before running code.

2. Specify parameters `distRatio`, `imresizerate1` and `imresizerate2` in `run_matching.m`.

3. Run `run_matching.m` to match key points extracted in two multi-source images.

Notes:

- Tuning parameters to larger value (from 0 to 1) will extract more key points and result in lower matching speed.

- The running time of establishing hyper-graphs and computing hyper-edge weights is not counted in the paper.
