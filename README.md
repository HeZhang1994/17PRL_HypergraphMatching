This is a **MATLAB** implementation of **hyper-graph matching** for multi-source image correspondences. 

The method is presented in paper: [Game theoretic hypergraph matching for multi-source image correspondences](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/305696390_Game_Theoretic_Hypergraph_Matching_for_Multi-source_Image_Correspondences).

## Dependency

* __sift win32__

Install SIFT libraries on **Windows** system (32-bit/64-bit) by executing `siftWin32.exe`.

## Usage

1. Prepare pairs of multi-source images in a folder (e.g., `images/`).

2. Specify parameters (`distRatio`, `imresizerate1` and `imresizerate2`) in `run_matching.m` (see comments).

3. Run `run_matching.m` to match key points in pairs of multi-source images via hyper-graph matching.

Notes:

- Tuning `distRatio` to larger value in [0, 1] will generate more key points and lead to lower matching speed.

- The running time does not include establishing hyper-graphs and calculating the weight of hyper-edges.
